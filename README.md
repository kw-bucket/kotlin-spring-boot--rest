# Preface

⛩️This repository contains source code mimic from microservice I developed for company 🏢 (when I worked with them).
To remind myself of experiences I have encountered (No.. not that bad, I'm joking).

Actually, I admitted that not all software design are sensible due to requirements or something under the surface (🤔agree?).
So, When I did programming that fulfill tha..tha..that design as tidy and neatly as I can.
Then, I think I should keep what I worked on for the sake of future use (or recall). 😉

Lastly. Please Don't worry. I've erased all relevant about the company essential business factors. 
And keep only programming logic. 😇👍🏻
